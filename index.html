<p>
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) applies to  websites. [1,2,3]  A digital divide occurs when websites deny access, isolate and deprive users who live in rural areas, [4,5] have older computers, are sick, visually impaired, with temporary or permanent physical limitations such as - broken bones, cancer, lymphedema, cataracts, strokes, and palsy. Websites are being sued, because they are not accessible.
